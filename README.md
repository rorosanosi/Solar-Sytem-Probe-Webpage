# Solar-Sytem-Probe-Webpage

Hackathon winner in the category: MLH best use of Gemini API. In 24 hours, my team and I developed an interactive solar system simulation web page based on solar probes. The page was created using HTML, while the orbit simulations were coded via Javascript, using a logarithmic scale. Google's Gemini API was integrated in our page to create a chatbot that answers space probe related questions. All the pixel visuals and icons were created from scratch using Piskel.
